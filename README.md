# Like Police v2

Welcome to the second version of the infamous GroupMe Like Police! This bot serves as a patroller on GroupMe Groups allowing authorized users to request reminders on liked posts.

## Commands

The following command table is all of the current commands for LikePolice. The Bot will only look for the command if the text contains @LikePolice (case insitivie, @Like Police is also fine). The command must be mentioned somewhere in the text (does not matter where). Some commands have follow up options you can add.

| Action | Command Options | Providable Options | Example |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| remind after a given duration (in whole minutes) | `remind`, `stalk`, `stake out`, `get on it` | Time (in whole minutes, eg. 60) <br /> `defaut = 10` | `@LikePolice, remind me to check these texts in 10`

## Known Limitations
- For now, all reminders must be under 60 minutes (anything over 60 minutes will remind you in 60 minutes)
- Only 2 reminders can be set at the same time :unamused:

Enjoy! - CB
